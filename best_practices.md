# ðŸ“˜ Project Best Practices

## 1. Project Purpose
This repository is an end-to-end (E2E) UI testing suite for the public website https://automationexercise.com using Cypress v14. It automates key user flows such as user signup, login, contact form submission, and general navigation. Tests are written in JavaScript with Cypressâ€™s chaining model and use fixtures and custom commands to keep steps reusable.

## 2. Project Structure
- Root
  - `cypress.config.js` â€” Cypress configuration and Node event hooks (expand as needed)
  - `package.json` â€” Project metadata and dev dependency on Cypress
  - `best_practices.md` â€” This guide
- `cypress/`
  - `e2e/` â€” Test specs organized by feature/domain
    - `Contact/contact.cy.js` â€” Contact form flow
    - `User/login.cy.js` â€” Login flows (valid/invalid, logout)
    - `User/signup.cy.js` â€” User registration flows
    - `Checkout/checkout.cy.js`, `Shop/shop.cy.js`, `UI_misc/ui.cy.js` â€” Present but currently empty; grow tests here
  - `fixtures/`
    - `users.json` â€” Test users data used across scenarios
    - `Helloworld.txt` â€” Sample file for upload tests
  - `support/`
    - `commands.js` â€” Custom Cypress commands (signupUser, loginUser)
    - `e2e.js` â€” Global support, imports custom commands
    - `utils/userHelper.js` â€” Placeholder for reusable helpers (currently empty)
  - `downloads/`, `screenshots/` â€” Cypress outputs (when enabled)

Conventions observed:
- Tests grouped by feature folders (Contact, User, Shop, Checkout, UI_misc)
- Custom commands abstract repeated UI workflows (signupUser, loginUser)
- Fixtures provide reusable static test data (users.json)

Recommended configuration improvements:
- Set `baseUrl` in `cypress.config.js` to avoid hardcoding the full URL in tests
- Add `retries`, `viewportWidth/Height`, and `defaultCommandTimeout` tuned for stability on CI

Example `cypress.config.js` adjustments:
```js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'https://automationexercise.com',
    retries: { runMode: 2, openMode: 0 },
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // implement node event listeners here
      return config
    },
  },
  viewportWidth: 1366,
  viewportHeight: 768,
})
```

## 3. Test Strategy
- Framework: Cypress 14.x (E2E focus)
- Organization: Feature-oriented directories; one or more `.cy.js` specs per feature
- Data: `cy.fixture('users')` to hydrate test users; pass objects into custom commands
- Reuse: `Cypress.Commands` for complex flows (signup, login)
- Selectors: Prefer stable, intention-revealing attributes (data-qa). Avoid brittle CSS like `:nth-child()` when possible
- Assertions: Use `.should()` with visibility/text checks; pair with URL/route assertions when navigation is expected
- Test types:
  - End-to-End: Majority of current tests interact with the live site (network, UI)
  - Integration (recommended for stability): Use `cy.intercept()` to stub non-critical network calls when deterministic results are required
  - Component tests: Not used here
- Mocking/Stubbing philosophy:
  - Because this suite targets a public site, tests are susceptible to network flakiness and content changes. Stub selectively (e.g., banner calls, analytics) to reduce flakiness while keeping critical flows truly E2E
- Coverage expectations:
  - Prioritize core user journeys (signup, login, contact, checkout) with happy paths first
  - Add negative and edge cases next (invalid credentials, existing email, required-field validation)
- Session management:
  - Use `cy.session()` to cache authenticated state across tests for speed when appropriate

## 4. Code Style
- Language: JavaScript with Cypressâ€™s Promise-like chaining; do not use async/await with Cypress commands
- Naming:
  - Specs: `feature-name.cy.js` within feature folders
  - Tests: Descriptive `it()` titles expressing scenario and expectation (avoid only numeric case IDs)
  - Variables: `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for classes (rare in tests)
- Selectors:
  - Prefer data attributes (e.g., `[data-qa="login-button"]`) and semantic queries (e.g., `cy.contains('text')` with context) over brittle `:nth-child()`
- Comments & language:
  - Keep comments concise and consistent; choose a single language for code comments and test titles. If the team is bilingual, prefer English for consistency with tooling/docs
- Assertions & timeouts:
  - Avoid arbitrary `cy.wait()`; rely on element state and route assertions. Tune command timeouts via config when needed
- Control flow:
  - Avoid `cy.pause()` in committed code. Use it locally during debugging only
- Reusability:
  - Keep custom commands pure and explicit. Return structured results (e.g., `{ status: 'created' | 'exists', user }`) so tests can branch deterministically
- Idempotency:
  - For signup flows, ensure unique emails (append timestamp or GUID) or delete users at the end to prevent data pollution

## 5. Common Patterns
- Custom Commands
  - `signupUser(user)` encapsulates registration steps and currently bails out early if email exists. Prefer returning a status to make test expectations explicit
  - `loginUser(user)` handles auth; consider `cy.session()` for caching
- Fixtures
  - `users.json` centralizes test data. Derive variants in tests (e.g., wrong email) by cloning and overriding fields
- Navigation
  - Use `baseUrl` + relative paths (`cy.visit('/')`). Assert URL via `cy.location('pathname')`
- File Upload
  - Use `cy.get('input[type="file"]').selectFile('cypress/fixtures/Helloworld.txt')`. Keep sample files small and under version control
- Network Control (recommended)
  - Use `cy.intercept()` to stub or assert key requests (form submissions, auth) and increase determinism
- Test Data Hygiene
  - If the app persists accounts, either delete at teardown or always generate unique identities

## 6. Do's and Don'ts
- Do
  - Configure `baseUrl`, retries, viewport, and default timeouts in `cypress.config.js`
  - Prefer `[data-*]` attributes and avoid brittle selectors
  - Centralize repeated flows in `Cypress.Commands`
  - Keep specs independent; do not rely on execution order or shared state
  - Use unique emails for signup (e.g., `user+{timestamp}@example.com`)
  - Add CI-friendly scripts: `cypress run` with JUnit/Mochawesome reporters if needed
  - Document preconditions and expected outcomes in `it()` titles
- Don't
  - Commit `cy.pause()` or `cy.wait(<arbitrary-ms>)` except as a last resort
  - Depend on `:nth-child()` ordering or dynamic text without context
  - Make tests depend on previous test success (no cascading failures)
  - Mix responsibilities in a single test; prefer smaller, focused scenarios

## 7. Tools & Dependencies
- Key dependency
  - Cypress ^14.5.4 â€” E2E test runner
- Suggested `package.json` scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "cy:open": "cypress open",
    "cy:run": "cypress run",
    "cy:run:headed": "cypress run --headed --browser chrome"
  }
}
```
- Setup
  - Node.js LTS recommended
  - Install: `npm ci` (or `npm install`)
  - Run headed: `npx cypress open`
  - Run headless: `npx cypress run`

## 8. Other Notes
- External site dependency: Since tests hit a public site, expect intermittent flakiness due to network or site changes. Mitigate with retries, resilient selectors, and limited stubbing
- Consistency: Standardize language across test names and comments
- Dead code: `cypress/support/utils/userHelper.js` is empty; implement helpers there or remove the file
- Custom commands contract: Adjust `signupUser` to return an explicit outcome so tests can assert correctly when an email already exists
- Stability: Replace `:nth-child()` selectors in specs and commands where feasible with stable attributes or text with scoping
- CI: Add reporters and artifacts (screenshots/videos) as needed for triage. Consider parallelization and test retries in CI
